# iOS-Business-Finder

This is an educational project. Its intended to help me improve my iOS
development skills, with a focus on testing and refactoring. It seemed like
"get the user's location, get some information from an API based on the user's
location, parse it, and display it a tableview" is a pretty common requirement,
so I thought that working my way through that task would be instructive. I'm
using OCMock to make fakes for testing, and I'm using Cocoapods to install
OCMock. Information on nearby businesses comes from the FourSquare API.
